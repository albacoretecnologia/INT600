To validate USB, do as follows:

1) Login, using SSH, in the board:
   > ssh root@<ConnectCore IP Address>
   If needed, to check the IP Address, use in the Putty terminal:
   > ifconfig
   
   Read the IP address of the Ethernet interface and use the read IPV4 address.

2) Issue the command:
   > lsusb
   
   A list of two devices should return:

   Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:2513  
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002  
      
3) Connect a pendrive with a single partition in the first USB interface and issue the command:
   > lsusb
   
   A list of 03 USB devices should return from this command. The connected USB pendrive should return with the above two devices.
   
4) Issue the command:
   > cat /proc/partitions
   
   At the end of the return string, should appear two sda devices (Size value depends on the used pendrive capacity):
   
   8        0    3932160 sda
   8        1    3932144 sda1

   
5) Use the command:
   > mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
   
   The pendrive should be mounted in /mnt directory
   
6) Use the command to check if the pendrive content is available:
   > ls /mnt
   
   The files and directories available and recorded in the used pendrive should be displayed. 
   Does not use a blank pendrive in this test. Something must be stored in it.

7) Umount the device.
   > umount /mnt
   
Change the pendrive to the second USB connector and repeat the above sequence.
